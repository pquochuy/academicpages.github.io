About
======
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford (UK), working with [Prof. Maarten De Vos](https://cibim.eng.ox.ac.uk/). I defensed my Ph.D. (Dr.-Ing. in German system) thesis at the [Institute for Signal Processing](https://www.isip.uni-luebeck.de/), [University of LÃ¼beck](https://www.uni-luebeck.de/) (Germany), working with [Prof. Alfred Mertins](https://www.isip.uni-luebeck.de/people/alfred-mertins.html). The thesis received the grade "summa cum laude". I received my M.Eng. in Computer Engineering from the [School of Computer Engineering](http://scse.ntu.edu.sg/), [Nanyang Technological University](http://ntu.edu.sg/) (Singapore) and my B.Sc. in Computer Science from the [University of Science at Ho Chi Minh City](http://web.hcmus.edu.vn/en/) (Vietnam).

My research interests include machine learning and signal processing with applications in environmental sound analysis and healthcare.

My CV is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g4ub8vbslvb3zfc/CV_Huy.pdf?dl=1).
